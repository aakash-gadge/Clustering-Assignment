# Clustering-Assignment
Using clustering to identify patterns in given countries based on the data available

In this assignment, we have been tasked with recommending countries to
the NGO which could largely benefit from the financial aid.
For this purpose, we have provided with historical data of countries on
various factors like its GDP, Income per Capita, expenditure on exports,
imports and health, and also some important parameters like child mortality
rate, average life expectancy and fertility rate.
We need to provide recommendation about countries which tend to perform
weakly on 3 target parameters i.e. gdpp, income and child_mort

This case study was part of my course curriculum and the data used and attached was provided by upGrad.
